The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All's well that ends well.
